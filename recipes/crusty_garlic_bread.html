    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a wonderful, Crusty Garlic Bread recipe – nothing too fancy, just pure goodness. Yum! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>60g butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>1 part-baked white baguette (about 150g)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>

        <li>Put the butter in a bowl, add the garlic and mix well. Spoon the butter out onto a sheet of cling film and roll up to make a sausage-shaped log. Chill for 10 mins.</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Slice the baguette into about 12 slices but not all the way through, leaving the base intact to hold it together.</li>
        <li>Remove the cling film from the butter and thinly slice on a chopping board. Press each butter slice between the slices of bread.</li>
        <li>Wrap the baguette in foil, place on a tray and bake for 5–6 mins, then peel back the foil. Cook for a further 4–5 mins to crisp up.</li>
    </ol>
